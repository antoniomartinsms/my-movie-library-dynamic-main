1,Code of Honor,https://nepsacademy.github.io/my-movie-lib/assets/images/code-of-honor-poster.png,4,02/10/2025,"An exemplary tale of programming virtue and determination. The plot twists were as unexpected as a segmentation fault. A must-watch for every developer."
2,The Merge Conflict,https://nepsacademy.github.io/my-movie-lib/assets/images/the-merge-conflict-poster.jpg,4,01/22/2025,"The Merge Conflict is a tense, character-driven tech drama that dives deep into the emotional and ethical battles behind collaborative coding. Centered around a fractured development team facing a critical software deadline, the film captures the pressure, pride, and personal tensions that arise when visions collide. With sharp dialogue, stylish visuals, and a touch of humor, it explores how even the smallest conflict in code can reveal the biggest differences in people."
3,Debugging Reality,https://nepsacademy.github.io/my-movie-lib/assets/images/debugging-reality-poster.jpg,4,10/28/2023,"A mind-bending thriller that will make you question everything. The film follows a lone programmer who discovers that the fabric of existence is just poorly-written legacy code. The visual representation of 'debugging' the world—setting breakpoints in time, stepping through logical fallacies, and patching glitches in physics—is nothing short of breathtaking. A smart, suspenseful journey that handles its complex theme with style. You'll never look at a déjà vu the same way again."
4,The Neps Protocol,https://nepsacademy.github.io/my-movie-lib/assets/images/the-neps-protocol-poster.png,5,10/10/2016,"The Neps Protocol is a gripping adventure that blends technology, mystery, and emotion as it follows a young programmer, his dog, and a charming robot on a journey through the foggy streets of a futuristic city. With a striking visual style and cinematic atmosphere, the film balances lightness and tension while exploring themes like programming ethics, friendship, and the impact of artificial intelligence on the modern world."
